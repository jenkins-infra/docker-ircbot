README for backend-ircbot
=========================

This package is a quick and dirty hack to provide
the backend-ircbot project as a Debian package
for usage on the http://jenkins-ci.org/
infrastructure.

The build process doesn't use maven-debian-helper
but instead calls the main maven tool itself.

To build the binary Debian package you might want
to run something like:

  yes | debuild -uc -us -I\.git

on your Debian system.
